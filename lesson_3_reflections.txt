When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are working from multiple terminals, like at work and home.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having GIT automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	So you are working with the exact version of the codebase that you want, not some arbitary branch that GIT decides.
