When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are working from multiple terminals, like at work and home.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having GIT automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	So you are working with the exact version of the codebase that you want, not some arbitary branch that GIT decides.

Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use on instead of another?
	- Fork is a special type of clone used when you pull a repository from github
	- Clone is when you copy an existing repository
	- branch is when you split a repository on two or more development tracks.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	So you can work on the most up-to-date version of the code if you are somewhere where
	push and pull won't work.
